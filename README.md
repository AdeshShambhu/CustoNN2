### Command line instructions
On the cluster infrastructure of PC2, you will be using the command line interface to manage your git repository.

Setup your git settings (since your home directory is mounted from every machine in the PC2 clusters, you only have to do this once).

```
git config --global user.name "<Firstname Lastname>"
git config --global user.email "<your email address>"
```

Clone the repository

```
git clone git@git.uni-paderborn.de:cs-hit/pg-custonn2-2018.git
```
