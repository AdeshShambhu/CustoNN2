# Kernel Structuring
kernels folder inside the OpenCL_kernels folder of the tvm branch contain the handwritten kernels and kernels genreated by relay and nnvm required for execution of GooglNet CNN

*  **conv** - contains handwritten convolution kernel and modified convolution kernels generated by relay
*   **other_module**s - contains handwritten softmax,avgpool,maxpool and concat kernels.
*   **inception_modified** - contains kernels arranged according to inception modules of the GoogleNet generated by nnvm.
*    nnvm -  contains 2 files: **inception_modified_nnvm.cl** - Single .cl file containing all kernels which are genrated by nnvm and then modified by the user  
  and **inception_modules** - kernels generated by nnvm modified by user and arranged in inception modules.
