## Tensorflow execution of Googlenet 
- Tensorflow implementation [Googlenet.py](https://git.uni-paderborn.de/cs-hit/pg-custonn2-2018/blob/tvm/OpenCL_Kernels/Testing_code/googlenet.py)(a python file) in this dir allows us to run any frozen pb file
- Make sure you have Tensorflow , scipy , opencv , numpy packages. 
- We can take advantage of this to run Googlent for verification of our kernel implementations
- To run the implementation until any given layer , just change `run_until` ex : `run_until = 'InceptionV1/InceptionV1/Mixed_4c/Branch_1/Conv2d_0a_1x1/Relu:0'`  
   Please refer to [TF Googlenet tensor names](https://git.uni-paderborn.de/cs-hit/pg-custonn2-2018/blob/tvm/OpenCL_Kernels/Testing_code/TF_Googlenet_Layers.txt) 
- The output will be stored in  the location specified in ` file_path_xxxx` where xxxx stands for NHWC or NCHW .
- You can print out the contents of `Session_out` for any layer to see the output.
- The format used by TF is NHWC in this case. So modify your print statements appropriatley.
- Script works well until InceptionV1/InceptionV1/Mixed_5c/concat:0. After that , the remaining Ops` outputs can be easily generated by hand
- TODO: The results of all the layers are to be stored in a common directory . Until 4c Branch1 COnv 1x1 done
