# GoogLeNet Baseline Architecture
This directory contains the OpenCL kernels for GoogLeNet. The Deep Neural Network(DNN) is split linearly in various points over the network and the division of the network was based
on inception modules. Each OpenCL kernel files contain one inception module.  
In this design we are using the kernels generated by TVM for Googlenet, hence we are using FPGA global memory throughout the network.
We have generated bitstreams for each of these files and these bitstreams will be flashed onto nine Stratix 10 FPGAs available in Noctua cluster. So, we need 5 Noctua nodes for inference of GoogLeNet. Intermediate
results between kernels inside the OpenCL file will be transferred using Global memory and we plan to use MPI for transfer of intermediate results between devices and nodes.

- Bitstream location : `/upb/scratch/departments/pc2/groups/pc2-cc-user/custonn2/designs/googlenet_bitstreams`
- Command to generate bitstream : `make inception_<module_name>`
- Command to execute the plugin using srun : 


If you wish to change the directory of bitstream, please change the value of `design_dir` in the Makefile.
