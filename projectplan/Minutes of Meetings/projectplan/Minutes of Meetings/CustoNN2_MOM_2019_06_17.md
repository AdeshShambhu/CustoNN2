##### Research/Individual Task Updates: Task Updates
- Performance model - We have a tool to calculate number of operations OpenCL file.  
- TVM Quantization - We have a quantized inceptionV1 model from Tensorflow in TFLite format. It can be compiled to generate new kernel. This task in progress. 
We also have Quantization Support from TVM and have generated Kernels using this. We were able to generate kernels using tvm quantize function are analyzing the Resource Utilization.
