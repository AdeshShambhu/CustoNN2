### Notes and Decisions 
##### Project organization updates


##### Research/Individual Task Updates: Task Updates
-   Performance modelling down for Googlenet hybrid design. We now identify bottlenecks and try to make the design faster.
-   Also performance modeling was done for Resnet units.
-   We were able to generate all bitstreams for Googlenet optimized kernels. The total execution time is 5.15 secs from profile.mon files.
