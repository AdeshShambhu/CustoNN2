### Notes and Decisions 
##### Project organization updates
1. Team gave status update to Dr.Kenter. Milestone 1 is complete.
2. Dr.Kenter suggested  not only to focus on Milestone 2 tasks but also on future tasks like Scaling of our system over multiple FPGAs. The idea of using Network on Chip was discussed and discarded as it is not suitable for our implementation.  
3. Merge DLDT with CustoNN2 and TVM needs to be brought into Version Control.
4. DLDT linked with Slack. Need the same to be done with CustoNN2.
5. Alina takes over as the team leader . Duration : Until Milestone 2 (22nd May)
##### Research/Individual Task Updates: Task Updates
1. Team OpenVino : Milestone 1 is working . Need to test more than one Image.
2. Team TVM : Focus now on GoogLeNet as Simple CNN is not working properly.
3. Documentation : Design document completed. It is being maintained as a living document.
##### Project decisions
1. Team OpenVino : Test the kernels. Experiment scaling with Simple CNN and then with Googlenet. 
2. Team TVM : Scrapping the previous tasks and focuing on Googlenet.
3. Team Documentation : Write Milestone 1 report. Should include : What was done , what is left to be done , what was tested , how was it tested, which tools were involved , should we move on to next steps , how and where we faced problems and their solutions . Sections should be in bullet points.
