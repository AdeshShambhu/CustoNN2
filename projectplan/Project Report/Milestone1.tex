\chapter{Plan for Milestone 1}
In this phase,there were three main objectives. The first objective was to develop and test  a plugin for OpenVINO and the second objective was to generate  kernel codes (in order to run a simple CNN topology on a single FPGA) using Tensor Virtual Machine (TVM). 
The third objective was to customize TVM codes for said plugin and to synthesize the codes for Stratix 10 board.



\chapter{Development of OpenVINO Plugin}
The development of OpenVino Plugin is a crucial objective of our project.This chapter contains the steps taken to create the first version of the plugin. This chapter also describes the tasks which were not completed (partially or completely). 
\subsection{Plugin development}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Deep Learning Deployment Toolkit (dldt) github repository was integrated into the university gitlab server. 
\item A folder named Noctua\_plugin was created inside dldt and another folder named kernels was created inside Nocuta\_plugin to store the bitstreams (.aocx files).
\item The development process started by editing the classification sample application to parse the IR of the given input topology. 
\item This parsed IR, which is stored in a data structure called CNNNetwork, is then passed on to the plugin. 
\item A single file named fpga\_plugin.cpp retrieved the layer information from the IR, launched the kernels on the FPGA after passing them the required arguments.
\item A customized Simple CNN kernel code (AOCL file) was used to test the plugin.
\item A single MNIST PNG file was used to test the launching capabilities of OpenVino. The image was correctly classified on emulator. Binary image files are not compatible with OpenVino. Thus , images in PNG format are to be passed to the plugin.
\end{itemize} 
\subsection{Summary of the progress}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The developed plugin supports convolution, max pooling and fully connected layers as required by the simpleCNN topology.
    \item OpenVino supports only PNG format images. Due to time constraints , only one PNG image was tested. Testing with more images is needed and will be done in Milestone 2.
    \item We used a hand-built kernel code file for launching kernels through this plugin. We were supposed  to use the kernel generated by TVM. This will be done in Milestone 2.
    \item The plugin was tested on an emulator. We were supposed to check if the plugin could launch kernels on Stratix 10 board. This will be done in the early stages of Milestone 2.
 
\end{itemize} 



\chapter{Using TVM to generate kernels}
Tensor Virtual Machine(TVM)  is being used as a code generator. This chapter describes the steps taken to setup the TVM tool and to generate kernel codes. This chapter also contains the tasks which were not completed.
\subsection{Development}
\begin{itemize}
    \item  Relay is imported which helps provide intermediate representation (IR) for the model.
    \item Tensorfow or caffe model (protobuf file) is imported and graph definition is created from the file with the help of tensorflow GraphDef class.
    \item On creating graph definition, it is imported into relay frontend to generate relay expression and parameters from tensorflow protobuf file. 
    \item The expression and parameters along with target host (OpenCL) are parsed to relay build function to create the final graph. 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Summary of the progress}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The final graph created is used to generate the OpenCL code.
    \item The kernel codes for Simple CNN were not generated. 
\end{itemize}

\chapter{ Customizing TVM generated kernels}  

\subsection{Custom code}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The third objective was to customize and synthesize the kernel code generated by TVM to suit the needs of OpenVino plugin.
    \item  A kernel code compatible with OpenVino was written manually because we were not able to use TVM to generate kernel codes for Simple CNN.
    
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Summary of the progress}
\begin{itemize}
\item TVM does not support custom models and hence CNN model has been scrapped and the focus is now on GoogleNet.
\item The synthesis and testing of the kernel code will be handled in the earlier stages of Milestone 2.


\end{itemize}

\chapter{Conclusion}
To summarize, not all the objectives as per the plan were achieved in milestone 1. 
\begin{itemize}
\item As discussed, a plugin was successfully developed for OpenVINO.
\item However, kernel codes were not generated using TVM due to the fact that TVM does not support custom models.
\item Since TVM could not generate kernel codes for CNN model, the focus has now shifted to GoogleNet, which will be achieved in milestone 2.
   
\end{itemize}
