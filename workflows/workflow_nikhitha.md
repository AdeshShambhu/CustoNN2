## Connection types and performance
- Currently prefer ssh for connecting to CC frontend.
- Xrdp also working with remote desktop client on Mac OS


## Repositories
- I have two copies of repositories, one in my working directory on the CC cluster frontend, another locally on my laptop.


## Local copies of documentation
- I have saved all the related  git documentation in a pdf and saved locally.

## Task 2
- We have currently logged in to the Custom Computing(CC) Cluster. This contains Nallatech 385A boards with Intel/Altera Arria 10 GX 1150 FPGA.  
- Later on I expect we would be using the Noctua cluster which contains Nallatech 520N boards with Stratix 10 FPGAs.

## Task 3
- Both ssh and xrdp connections are working properly for the CC cluster. 
- Altera Compiler Sanity checks were performed with the given commands in the documentation of FPGA .
- Path to my mounted user name is **/upb/departments/pc2/users/n/nikhitha**
- Able to edit and access .bashrc file from the CC Cluster.

# Task 4
## Documentation and Knowledge Base
### **FPGAs and OpenCL SDK tool versions**
- Worked with 2 tool versions: 17.1.2 and 18.0.1
- Each version supports different boards
- https://wiki.pc2.uni-paderborn.de/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=19562930.

### **Gitlab merge request**
- As a part of task 2, I created a new branch and pushed my changes on git. Then created a merge request.

### **aoc command line options**
- Used "-march=emulator" to create aocx file. We also specified the board with this command.

### **Mounting university file systems**
