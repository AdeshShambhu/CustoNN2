## Setting For Connections
- Using SSH and xRDP on Remmina-Ubuntu 18.04 to connect to CC Front-End.
- The performance via Eduroam is good , via home using Open-Vpn a little bit sluggish.

## Repositories

  2) Alpha Data 7v3 board with Xilinx Virtex-7 XC7VX690T FPGA.
- And the following Drivers - 
  1) Intel/Altera 17.1.2
  2) Xilinx SDx 2017.

## Activities of Task 3
- Able to conect to the CC Front End Cluster through both SSH and xRDP.
- Sanity checks performed on Intel/Altera FPGA SDK for OpenCL.
- User is mounted to the following path - **/upb/departments/pc2/users/a/anshul**
