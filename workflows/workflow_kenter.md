## Connection types and performance
- ssh used for most tasks
- editing files through mounted file system with local editor
- xrdp used for installing software with GUI installers, for viewing profiling results, ...
- keeping screen sessions within xrdp for synthesis jobs on CC frontend

- ssh performance is usually very good from office and home
- mounted file system performance is mostly good from office, from home sufficient to edit text files, but rather slow when browsing through files
- xrdp connections are good from office, sometimes suffer from resizing problems when switching between external and buildin monitor, so keep screen sessions for all synthesis jobs
