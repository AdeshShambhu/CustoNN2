### IntroductoryTask_Step2

*  Got a brief overview of the documentation of the FPGA/Custom Computing infrastructure from PC2 Wiki. 
* Expect to work at the Custom Computing infrastructure through the CC front end.    

### IntroductoryTask_Step3

* Able to connect to the CC front end using both "ssh" and "xrdp" network protocols. 
* Able to clone and access the project repository pg-custonn2-2018. 

### IntroductoryTask_Step4

* Connection to CC front-end through both "ssh" and "xrdp" is working well through home (VPN for xrdp!) and univeristy networks.
* I currently look to have one clone copy of the repository at the CC front end cluster infrastructure in order to use the Open CL tools available there. 
* I also look to have a 2nd clone copy of the repository on my local machine for writing/editing documentation. 
* Need some more clarity and idea regarding how to keep these 2 clone copies synchronized. 
*  Will you mount the shared file system from your local system ? How is the performance of this via various networks ? - Not having enough clarity regarding this step as of yet ! 

The End.
